The main points of their designs was for Dennis to have 'puffy pink cotton candy hair' and that he always wears a leather jacket, but otherwise doesn't particularly bother with his outfit. Abby's only point was that she is wearing the same leather jacket as Dennis. The rest was left up to me so I went about creating designs that would work with, and compliment the main piece of both characters; the jacket. <br><br>
For Dennis, my client went with the puffy hair of the first and the boxier body design. Abby was very quick to come to life, and didn't go through any real revisions.</center>

Abby, being a ghost that is teathered to an object, specifically the leather jacket in question, I wanted to have an interesting way to show that visually, so I ended up having the leather straps of their jacket cuffs serve that purpose. <br>There was also discussion on and ideas about what color to use for Abby, and I did have a version of her as a sort of light pink, but we ended up with the very classic blue green for her. I think it compliments the burgandy jacket and Dennis' cotton candy hair.

Amusingly enough, I've now done talkspites for an upcoming Monster Prom game mod that the creator and owner of these characters is working on.<br> I've endeavored to really hone in on the style of the game so they fit right in with the rest of the cast in the game. Abby doesn't get a complete standalone sprite here, she's a little different here in this mod, but you do get to see some of her here and there. <br><br>
