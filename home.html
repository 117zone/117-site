                        <h3>07|31|2025</h3>
                        <p>A weeks worth of nonsense incoming: I've moved my adult art over here because I'm tired of
                            maintaining 2 sites/ I'm Lazy. Other stuff from there will come over too. The downside is a
                            lot of webrings won't allow you to join if you have any nsfw on your site.... their loss I
                            guess? It feels bad being excluded though. I finally have reference sheets up on 3 of my
                            oc's pages now. I have more art on my regular gallery, including artfight attacks from this
                            month. It was my first time participating. I don't know if I'll be doing it next year or not
                            though. I got some art from it too though and I do like that. </p>

                        <p>I plan on converting my site to 11ty some time soon, if I don't lose the motivation to do so.
                            It would be nice to just deploy my site instead of uploading each updated file manually....
                        </p>

                        <p>The resources page is also updated with new entries for making your own website. I want to
                            spread the good word of owning your space on the net. Please come make a website, it's fun
                            (and sometimes annoying) but worthwhile!</p>
                        <h3>03|20|2025</h3>
                        <p> New art has been added to the gallery! I've also added a bit more to my about, and a link to
                            my <a href="https://backloggd.com/u/117zone/">new backlogged account.</a></p>
                        <h3>03|17|2025</h3>
                        <p>Ohhhh my gooooooood I finally did it. I added a little bit of my OC world stuff here today.
                            World lore and 4 character pages. I'm a bit nervous about opening up and showing something
                            very personal to strangers on the net... but I'm just going to assume most people won't look
                            at it. If you do though, thank you, and sorry none of them have galleries yet, it was either
                            no gallery and post them now or post it weeks from now with them. I opted for the former.
                        </p>
                        <p>I also edited my splash to have information about this site's responsiveness/accessibility...
                            and to indicate that I would like to have more specifically adult themes here, while still
                            keeping the visually explicit content on my side site. I've embraced being a weird freak
                            everywhere else, it's weird to exclude my personal site from that. I'll elaborate on that in
                            a blog post or something maybe.</p>
                        <h3>01|19|2025</h3>
                        <p>No posts or art because some meds I'm on have made me just completely unable to be creative
                            or draw without struggling against it, and now there's other health things going on, and the
                            world is a hateful place and it's made it hard to think about adding anything here. I should
                            probably set up something like zonelets or the like so i can just blog here proper, in
                            addition to bluesky. Hope things treat you, whoever you are reading this, decently. </p>
                        <h3>09|24|2024</h3>
                        <p>I took the dive and attempted to organize some of the mess in my file structure, and update
                            some of my css to be
                            more versatile, and fix some layouts that weren't actually mobile friendly (I thought they
                            were? turns out they
                            weren't??). BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I have <a href="https://117.zone/office/pendrawer"></a>
                            fountain pen page</a>,
                            a <a href="https://117.zone/skeleton/tv">media/inspiration page</a>, and a place to <a
                                href="https://117.zone/office/opinions">ramble
                                about things</a> I have Opinions on. This feels like a massive update, but I still have
                            so much more I want to do, like OC pages,
                            but I need to let that sit while I get other things not related to webmastery done.</p>
                        <h3>09|17|2024</h3>
                        <p> I am oh so sleepy eepy from getting almost no sleep and then getting my seasonal covid
                            booster + flu vaccine today...................... but<br>
                            I have a guestbook now! I'm using the code from <a
                                href="https://virtualobserver.moe/ayano/comment-widget">here</a>, and there's alt text
                            on my newly added art plus I almost finished my fountain pen page! Also, man, I'm really
                            feeling like adding a currently inked pen and currently listenign to bits on this page, I
                            think that would be fuuuun. </p>
                        <h3>09|14|2024</h3>
                        <p>Fixed most of the stuff I knew of. The resource list should be easier to read now, the
                            headers look better now, and the mobile format looks decent. I think I added the language
                            tag to every page? May have missed some. Still need to add alt text on the new art. Hope
                            yall enjoy though. Oh, I still need a new guestbook too. </p>
                        <h3>09|13|2024</h3>
                        <p>I still need to change a couple visual elements and fix a couple bugs but I restructured the
                            site to suck a little
                            less. There's also a few tweaks here and there on a few pages, some dithering for hashtag
                            Aesthetic reasons, and to lighten the loading just a tiny bit.
                            It shouldn't be such a pain to manage everything now, I hope??</p>
                        <p>I started work on coding a new gallery format for a fountain pen page, and I want to get my
                            original characters their own pages and open up about them publicly, finally (whenever I
                            feel the motivation and have time and energy?????).
                        </p>

                        <h3>09|05|2024</h3>
                        New art! Animated art! 3D Renders! Wow! Lots of new resources as well! I hope the resources are
                        helpful, there's a bunch of art and some fashion related ones as well as entertaining sites in
                        there
                        now, and I intend to keep adding neat and useful links as it feels harder and harder to just use
                        a
                        web search to find anything of substance. You'll also see some graphics changing and getting
                        shuffled around, I'm working on keeping my personal aesthetic a bit different from a group I'm
                        in
                        that I've done the branding/vast majority of graphic design/identity for, which... wasn't THAT
                        different from what I was rocking here. (I have my habits, damn it all. ) <br>
                        Since this is the one actual news section of this site.... I will also announce that you should
                        absolutely check out what me and 5 friends are doing over at the afore mentioned group, <a
                            href="https://club-eclipse.studio"> Club E-Clipse </a>because it's basically us banding
                        together
                        to make art a viable way to support ourselves. We recently had our debut stream on twitch and
                        have
                        now subsequently uploaded it on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Club-Eclipse"> youtube
                            channel
                        </a> for your entertainment. ((thank you if you give us a moment of your time!))
                        <h3>05|15|2024</h3>
                        I'm going to be updating the art section soon, hopefully within a few weeks. I've been busy with
                        a
                        whole host of different things including learning 3D, and starting several projects with
                        different
                        people, so updating the site wasn't a pressing issue, and I'm only recently making some more
                        stuff I
                        can share publicly.
                        <h3>03|15|2024</h3>
                        I don't have a lot of finished works I can show yet so the website remains largely untouched as
                        I
                        have other things that need more attention. There are ebbs and flows with webmastering for me,
                        and
                        this is one of those periods where it can't quite take all my attention and energy. I hope to
                        share
                        more soon, or at the very least, when I am able and ready to!

                            <p> Happy new belated new year! I'm taking down the christmas lights here. Not much to
                                update
                                right
                                now as far as the website goes. Doing a lot of non website things though, hope to share
                                that
                                stuff soon.
                            <h3>12|25|2023</h3>
                            <p>Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to those who celebrate any of the MANY holidays around
                                this
                                and next month! I do love Christmas, though, I got slammed with work earlier this month
                                so
                                the
                                most I was able to do has been decorating the site, a tree, and some stickers here and
                                there
                                on
                                some paper goods. I wish I had more time to savor the holiday cheer, but I'll be
                                watching
                                the
                                Rankin Bass Rudolph special while opening presents, and I think that'll be good enough.
                                Have
                                a
                                happy and safe new year yall!</p>
                            (oh, and, please ignore the neocities view counter, it's so bafflingly inflated, I think I
                            just
                            made
                            the bots happy with accidental SEO, all my other counters/analytics are so much more
                            conservative,
                            including the one here on this page haha)
                            <h3>12|08|2023</h3>
                            Great news! all the art in my gallery aside from the sketches have alt text! This absolutely
                            would
                            not have happened without my partner who wrote them for me. I'm adding empty alt tags to
                            stuff
                            that
                            doesn't matter too much and we'll work on doing more for other assorted graphics that do add
                            to
                            the
                            feel of the site.
                            <h3>12|02|2023</h3>
                            Christmas! Christmas decorations! I decorated in real life and then went over to gif cities
                            to
                            grab
                            some Christmas light gifs to decorate my digital home as well.
                            I also completely redid my music page, <a href="/skeleton/radio.html">skeleton radio</a>,
                            added
                            a <a href="/office/blog.html">blog</a> page because I already decided against having an
                            offsite
                            one,
                            and did some cleaning up in the code of almost every page and reorganization of my graphic
                            assets.
                            Oh and I've been adding media query for reduced motion, but I'm sure I missed stuff (if you
                            notice
                            anything please email me or comment on my neocities profile!)<br>Lotta work!
                            <h3>11|30|2023</h3>
                            Changed the links up a bit, making room for more pages. I need to set aside time for
                            implementing
                            reduced motion behaviors but it's very intimidating how much I'm going to have to fiddle
                            with
                            it. (I
                            get this way about every large change/project) I opened a <a
                                href="https://117zone.dreamwidth.org/">dreamwidth account</a> to blog about stuff, I'm
                            not
                            sure
                            the tone of it yet.
                            <h3>11|24|2023</h3>
                            Updated the commission page, took all day to make a form on jotform that I feel works for
                            me.
                            I'm
                            very tired of staring at my computer screen, I'll come back to update some other things
                            another
                            day,
                            I have people I want to add to my links but I can't stare at this monitor any longer. (I'm
                            just
                            going to stare at a different monitor while I draw)
                            <h3>11|11|2023</h3>
                            I succumbed to madness, I rearranged a lot of the design on the main site pages (the side
                            pages
                            like
                            music and fashion are the same, for better or worse, I like them enough). The previous
                            design
                            only
                            lasted 2-ish months, oh well. I took the time to also clean the code a smidge, it was
                            getting a
                            little too spaghetti like for my preferences. There's a lot to do still in between... a lot
                            of
                            other
                            things in other parts of my life. The major to-do list is<BR><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>make a landing page for my interests/collections</li>
                                <li>create a new logo, and some icons, and other assets</li>
                                <li>commit to changing my splash page after 2+ years.</li>
                            </ul><br>
                            Oh, and maybe I could use a personal diary. I flip flop on using dreamwidth or just hacking
                            some
                            more messy code together.
                            <h3>>11|10|2023</h3>

                            Added an album and some cassettes to the music page. Working on a website for someone. Had
                            dental
                            work done. Got a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/117.zone">Bluesky</a> account (I have
                            codes,
                            if
                            someone reading this needs one, email me). Changed the domain to something that fits better.
                            In
                            a
                            bit of an odd spot with a lot of things, but doing my best. I think I'll be applying to
                            webrings
                            now.
                            <h3>>10|10|2023</h3>

                            This is the second month in a row I'm posting an update where the month and day are the
                            same.
                            Neat!
                            Updates tho! Two new pieces added to the gallery! Adjusted the layout a little bit, decided
                            against
                            making an elaborate about page and just changed it to a pretty simple page. It'll need some
                            additions but it's fine for tonight. I also added a link to my 18+ art site that is a huge
                            WIP
                            atm,
                            but it is up! Hope to have more updates soon!

                            <h3>>9|9|2023</h3>

                            New button for the site, bought a cheap domain name, and added the link back button here!
                            Really
                            feel like I made genuine progress these last few days. Oh, and I did it, I added some of my
                            clothes
                            to my fashion page! More needs to be added over time but it's a start!
                            <h3>>9|8|2023</h3>

                            I added some cds and vinyl I own to the <a href="/skeleton/radio.html">music page</a>. I
                            need to
                            add
                            more to the favorite artists section though, and there are several pages that need any
                            content
                            at
                            all, but it's a start, and I'll be happy enough with that for now.
                            <h3>>9|6|2023</h3>

                            Home page is completely reworked, SHOULD be responsive on mobile. There's a status.cafe box!
                            Theres
                            a chatbox! There's flexible boxes!<br><br> I also started making layouts for my fashion/j
                            fashion
                            and music pages but I've been too busy with remaking the home page that I haven't filled
                            them
                            with
                            any content whatsoever. The j fashion page has shit all for navigation either. Ah well, that
                            can
                            come later. I have an endless list of things I need and want to do here on this website...
                            <h3>>8|23|2023</h3>

                            More updates to code, and pages, and updated gallery are here. Hopefully more updates to
                            follow
                            soon, but there's new art in the galleries and it should generally work better, with links
                            to
                            the
                            work I've done that's been in published media, yipee.
                            <h3>>2|9|2023</h3>

                            Life has been swinging between as busy as possible to absolutely nothing happening, while
                            still
                            dealing with a lack motivation for a lot of things. All the same, I forsee things getting
                            easier,
                            and better soon enough. I'm in the middle of adding more pages, starting a proper blog, and
                            coding a
                            new homepage layout as I did lose the one I had just recently done. As Twitter slowly
                            becomes
                            even
                            more of an unsuable hellscape, it only motivates me further to continue to work on and
                            improve
                            this
                            little slice of the web. Definitely considering getting a real proper domain as well, but I
                            already
                            have one for my business so I need to find an inexpensive non dot com to get for this page.
                            <h3>>3|13|2022</h3>

                            A lot of layout changes and refinement, really tighting the website up and making it
                            functional.
                            Is
                            it done? No, but I don't think it ever will be. Am I happy with it? Sure!

                            <h3>>2|8|2022</h3>

                            Well, it's been a minute since I actually bothered to write an update here. Plenty of art,
                            character
                            design, and wig pictures updates are live in the galleries! I also hit 10,000 views here on

                            purchase

                            grab a copy @ <a href="vinylcitypride.wixsite.com/vinylcitypride">this webzone.</a> It's
                            been
                            seen
                            by the developers and voice actors of the game it's from. Pretty gamer huh?
                            <h3>>5|24|2021</h3>

                            Wow there's a lot to talk about for this update, huh? The site should be usable on mobile
                            now,
                            with
                            a new aesthetic, and less fussy navigation. The photography page is up, and I've added new
                            pieces to
                            the art page and a link to my new artstation page, and there's a new layout for the wig
                            page.
                            Commission page is more functional now, with parts of the form for illustration commissions
                            being
                            updated for clairity. Outside of technical updates, the site hit 5k views! I've also gotten
                            accepted
                            into a zine and animation project, when those release I'll drop the links here, can't share
                            much
                            for
                            now though.
                            <h3>>2|16|2021</h3>

                            "other" page is up and I now have one of my cosplay wig tutorials up on here for your use!
                            Will
                            keep
                            adding stuff as I have time/motivation/remember!
                            <h3>>2|06|2021</h3>

                            All pages except the 'other' page are fully functional! Took a lot of work to get the codec
                            styled
                            directory for my portfolio done but it's all finished and coded. CSS is even cooler than it
                            was
                            back
                            when I was making homepages on neopets. Consider looking through my illustration, cosplay,
                            and
                            wig
                            portfolios!
                            <h3>>1|30|2021</h3>

                            I have a link back button now, and so far 2 galleries semi functional but need to get the
                            main
                            page
                            for them together. One step at a time though!
                            <h3>>1|29|2021</h3>


                            <p>This website is wicked still under construction! I need to get a responsive gallery code
                                and
                                sort
                                out like 4 different pages of galleries, and do a whole host of other things but the
                                splash and
                                most
                                of the css and complicated code is all done. Whoevers reading this, yo!
