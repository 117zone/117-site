  <h1>12|08|2023: Material Posessions</h1>
  I don't think there's an appropriate way to start a blog so I'm just going to use it the way I intended it to be used, to let thoughts out that need to be freed.<br><br>
<p>I had a moment today. I have too much stuff. Physical posessions. I think I adopted a bit of a purchasing habit to feel something good.  I also keep a lot of things given to me a long time ago because I feel an obligation to the person who bought the thing for me to keep it. Some of those things don't mean anything to the person who gifted them, nor to me, except that it was a gift. I struggle to get rid of things because 'what if I can use this or what if I miss this other item' and it's weird. </p>
<p>I've done a good job of reducing the cosplays I have to only the ones I really care about. I think I need to do that with a lot of my possessions. Reduce how many figures and collectable nick nacks I have. Keep the things I really love, let go of some... a lot of fandom merch, keep the meaningful gifts, reduce the 'it could be useful one day' crap.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to try my best in the coming months to just buy music, commission art, and keep the rest of those kinds of purchases to a minimum, other than things that at least have a decent use, household items, ect. </p>
<p> Less of a new years resolution and more of a 'I feel like the amount of things I own is going to give me an anxiety attack, oh god this is a problem, fuck I have to change this NOW' issue.</p>
