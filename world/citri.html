                    <p>Nuisance, gremlin. It’s 50/50 if people like her company or think she’s just annoying. The people
                        who don’t like her still put up with her because she’s a well respected and immensely talented
                        engineer and craftsman.

                    </p>
                    <p>Wears Decora full time. The staples of her outfits being her railgun-selfmade, and her talking
                        eyeball ring Samson.
                    </p>
                    <p> Lives in an underground dwarven city.

                    <p>Dwarves have that reputation for being secluded and exclusive (in the same way gucci is exclusive
                        for rich people), which they’ve earned, to be fair. Citri is too outgoing for that seclusion
                        bullshit, but she absolutely acts like someone who knows her worth. She too, has earned that as
                        a master of engineering. The money she earns from being a well respected engineer who takes on
                        eccentric jobs all exclusively funds her wardrobe, the respect she commands means she can be a
                        gremlin and most people have to suck it up and pretend like she isn’t Too Much, Too Loud.

                    </p>
                    <p>Somehow, with everything in her life, she’s still capable of boredom, and every bone in her stone
                        body craves shit stirring, making problems, and being destructive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s why she hunts Anomalies. She’s bored and loves using her railgun. Being destructive
                        towards entities that deserve it is a better use of time than just ruining friendship after
                        friendship, anyway!
