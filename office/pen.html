    <p>These are all my fountain pens! I got into them January 2024, and I haven't looked back! I have troubles with my
      writing/drawing hand sometimes, and I find they've helped relive some of that, and teach me to draw lighter (even
      digitally) when I use them often, so I don't see myself writing with anything else any time soon.</p>
    <p>I took all the pictures with my dlsr, a canon EOS 6D (I bought it used in 2019), using my hobonichi cousin as the
      backdrop.</p>

    <h2 id="asvine1">Asvine P20 Marble Blue < M>
    </h2>
    <img src="https://117.zone/office/assets/pen_asvine1.png"><br>
    <p>I like this pen visually so much, and I love it's writing feel, even if I struggle with it drying out faster than
      my other pens. </p>
  </div>

    <h2 id="asvine2">Asvine P20 Gradual Yellow < M>
    </h2>
    <img src="https://117.zone/office/assets/pen_asvine2.png"><br>
    <p>I got this one as soon as I found out this color came out, since the pros of it are enough for me to have
      another. </p>

    <h2 id="lamy1">Lamy Safari Cream < M>
    </h2>
    <img src="https://117.zone/office/assets/pen_lamysafari1.png"><br>
    <p>I didn't start with a lamy because the Bauhaus design isn't THAT appealing to me but I wanted to try a German
      pen, and. Well. I do like it for it's durability and writing feel! </p>
  </div>

    <h2 id="lamy2">Lamy Safari Charcoal < F>
    </h2>
    <img src="https://117.zone/office/assets/pen_lamysafari2.png"><br>
    <p> When I was trying to decide what kind of pen I wanted to have as my dedicated document signing pen, I went back
      and forth for months but I ended up with another safari because I wanted something that I can toss in my pocket
      and not worry about, I think the lamy safari really delivers on that front. </p>

    <h2 id="pilot1">Pilot Metropolitan < M>
    </h2>
    <img src="https://117.zone/office/assets/pen_pilotmetro.png"><br>
    <p>Okay, I know this is a another 'starter pen' but it really just feels good to write with! </p>

    <h2 id="plat1">Platinum Plasir < F>
    </h2>
    <img src="https://117.zone/office/assets/pen_platplasir.png"><br>
    <p> I don't really have too much to say on this pen, I like it, but it feels too slippery sometimes, I have the same
      complaint with the preppy, which afaik, is the same nib. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="containing">
    <h2 id="plat2">Platinum Preppy < M>
    </h2>
    <img src="https://117.zone/office/assets/pen_platpreppy.png"><br>
    <p> I'm glad this pen is cheap and accessible, I really am! However.... the plastic cracked and the barcode being
      printed directly on the body is a bit of a turn off for me. It writes fine, but I had to tape up the crack</p>

    <h2 id="twsbi1">TWSBI Eco Smoke Rose Gold < F>
    </h2>
    <img src="https://117.zone/office/assets/pen_twsbieco1.png"><br>
    <p> This was my first pen! I did so much research into all the pens people consider beginner pens and I ended up
      with the eco, the ink capacity and the ability to clean it easily won me over. I'm not the biggest demonstator
      fan, tbh, but I do like this pen. The writing feel isn't out of this world or anything but it is just a good
      package over all! Obviously it convinced me fountain pens were the way to go from here on out.</p>

    <h2 id="twsbi2">TWSBI Eco Indigo Blue Bronze < EF>
    </h2>
    <img src="https://117.zone/office/assets/pen_twsbieco2.png"><br>
    <p> Truthfully, this is the pen I wanted first, the color is gorgeous, but it was sole out at the time I made the
      leap, and I was purchasing my first notebook to help with keeping my life organized, so I went with the smoke
      color instead and came back around to this one later. I'm not a huge extra fine guy fountain pen guy, I've come to
      learn, despite being big on the super thin line microns. So... I just use a pilot ink in there and it feels fine.

    <p>These were, of all of the pens, impulse purchases. I swapped around the finials, caps, and grips to make a little
      collection of Neapolitan icecream pens, lmao. The quality control here is real hit or miss tbh. I had gone into
      buying these knowing I was going to change one of them for a broad nib from another company, but one of them I had
      to take to sandpaper to get it to not feel miserable and scratchy. I think these are fun if you enjoy having
      things to work on. </p>
