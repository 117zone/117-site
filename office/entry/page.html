    <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>

    <p>I needed a place to put my thoughts down in a space less closed off than a paper journal that no one sees, but isn't broadcasting every inner thought to a social media platform. 
    If I can manage to not eradicate evidence of my personal feelings a year after I make them, this might be something someone can use to peer into my life some time later, 
    the way I used to peer into others' lives when I explored personal sites as a kid. </p>
    <p> it's fair to say the times I'm motivated to write here, I'm probably not writing for joyful happy reasons. SO your warning is thus: read if you wish but know there may be some mildly frustrated and/or melancholic writing ahead. <br>
    I do most of my positive writing elsewhere, in a book, or talking to friends. For better or worse.</p>
