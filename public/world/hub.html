                <h1>The World Lore Zone</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a world that has exclusively existed in my head, as an immersive sim for me to daydream
                    about being in. Things may seem a bit scattered, disorganized, and odd, as some things will be
                    omitted as it’s too personal or isn’t really a thing that needs to be out on the internet, and this
                    isn’t as presentable as I’d like.. That said…

                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a world in which there are odd things and occurrences, most of those things are very simply
                    called anomalies. They could be considered like SCPs, if there wasn’t some organization dealing with
                    them, and it was the job of basically anyone who is capable enough to dispose of troublesome enough
                    things. These anomalies almost exclusively come tumbling out of other worlds… planes of existence,
                    universes, whatever word you like. What might be normal in another world, could be a horrible blight
                    on this one. The same in reverse even!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should people consider them a bigger deal? Probably. But this world isn’t your world! There are
                    plenty of other differences between this world and yours, and that is just one of them. The
                    following is just a selection of the stuff floating around in my head that I’ve been able to capture
                    in words.

                </p>

                <h2>The Sun and The Moon</h2>

                <p style="text-align: center">
                    <img src="https://117.zone/assets/nav_moon.gif" width="200" > 
                    <img src="https://117.zone/assets/nav_sun_wobble.gif" width="200" >
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sun and moon just look like that
                </p>
                <h2>Angels and Demons</h2>

                <p style="text-align: center">
                    <img src="https://117.zone/world/assets/IMG_demons.png" width="300" > <img
                        src="https://117.zone/world/assets/IMG_angels.png" width="300">
                </p>
                <p>
                    There’s angels and demons, but like, they aren’t what you think they are. Rather, they are long
                    lived, eccentric creatures from another place, that are capable of willingly traveling to other
                    worlds, and deliberately do so. As much as they shouldn’t interfere in other worlds, they absolutely
                    do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One and the same, angels and demons are shapeshifting creatures where the only meaningful difference
                    between them is culture. Angels, who believe order and recordkeeping are most important, and demons
                    which embrace chaos and freedom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Angels imply and act like they don’t interact with humans. The more restrained take on a passive &
                    distant position when visiting this world. This manifests as angels taking the shape of objects, so
                    they somewhat minimize their impact. It’s debatable if this even works.It’s debatable how many
                    angels even bother resisting the urge to just be amongst the people.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Demons though, they revel in fully embracing and becoming fully immersed in earth cultures. In turn,
                    their disguises tend to take on the appearance of people but might playfully add in small,
                    fantastical or animalistic traits.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Between the two, their mingling with the residents of this world has certainly left an impact on it.
                </p>


                <h2>The Inbetween</h2>

                <p style="text-align: center">
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fleshy, gooey connective tissue between worlds. Traversable, easily for demons and angels, with
                    incredible difficulty for humans and those of this world.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Anomalies are really just things that made it through the tissue between two worlds. Usually
                    accidental, usually just slipping through their world, lucky enough to have a short path to the
                    next.

                </p>

                <h2>The Hotel</h2>

                <p style="text-align: center">
                    <img src="https://117.zone/world/assets/IMG_hotel.jpg" width="400"> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An anomaly that takes the shape of an unassuming hotel that found itself largely unbothered by
                    things that would remove it, and instead forming a symbiotic relationship with a caretaker to
                    survive. The caretaker must help it get food, but in return, it will take care of them.


                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a place you find yourself when you need it most, and the building itself, the living
                    creature, will adjust itself and make its room familiar and comfortable for that person. It can’t
                    communicate with language and in most ways it is utterly alien to many life forms, but it makes its
                    love and care for people known.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only visible flesh in the entire building is at the centre at an ever changing floor, found
                    through staff service halls. There, is a pit, where The Hotel feeds, with only a short catwalk
                    extending from the entrance. <br>
                    The walls, flesh.<br>
                    The support structures, bone.<br>
                    Watching, are the eyes lining the walls<br>
                    Gaping, the void of the pit.<br>
                </p>

                <h2>Dwarves</h2>
                <p>
                    Dwarven culture is entirely about craftsmanship, creating, and designing. The freedom to express
                    yourself freely through your chosen craft and through the way you adorn yourself with the goods you
                    make or the goods of your community is strongly protected and celebrated.
                    Though on the flipside, they can be very insular and unwilling to allow non dwarves into their
                    community, except on rare occasions. It’s borderline impossible to be taught by master dwarven
                    artisans as an outsider. They still engage in cultural exchanges though, and it’s extremely popular
                    to import their goods.

                </p>
                <p>

                    Children are born in the form of a ritual where the community gathers to carve a child out of stone.
                    Obviously the stone type is limited to the stones type in the region, so dwarves from different
                    areas can look pretty different! Artisans and novices alike participate in the birthing of a new
                    life.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole community will take the responsibility of raising that child. and as dwarves grow into
                    adulthood their body becomes organic, and when they pass their bodies return to stone, like statues
                    that are then set to rest in a memorial art gallery.
